The goal is to build coding muscle memory by following along with the instructor in the video.

## Rubric for code submission
 1. Follow the folder structure and naming conventions of the instructor in the video. 
 2. In total there **must** be at least 4 commits and each commit must be accompanied by 1 meaningful commit message
 3. Commit messages **must** be written in the imperative mood.
 4. Each commit **must** leave the code in a working state.
 5. **Must** include a 4-5 sentence summarizing what you worked on today. Please add your summary in the space provided below.

In this section, we explore asynchronous programming in JavaScript. The goal is to figure out how we can communicate with servers via HTTP requests, allowing our scripts to be able to fetch and send data. Making HTTP requests from the client-side JavaScript code, allows us to fetch a random generated puzzle for the popular hangman game. This lesson also shows how to use callbacks to simplify the code that makes our HTTP requests. We learn how to abstract the complexity of XMLHttpRequest into a simple function call. We also learn the distinction between asynchronous vs synchronous execution. Synchronous basically means that you can only execute one thing at a time. Asynchronous means that you can execute multiple things at a time and you don't have to finish executing the current thing in order to move on to next one. We also explore closures and promises. Promises was something I never heard of before. I learned that the Promise API is an alternative to callback functions which makes it easier to manage complex asynchronous code. Promises provide better error handling than callbacks and events. And interestingly enough, in order to create asynchronous promise-based code that looks like standard synchronous code, we use Async fuctions and await operators, referred to as async/await. Asynchronous programming proves that it is essential for improving application performance and responsiveness due to its great ability to store and retrieve persistent data.
