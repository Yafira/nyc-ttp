 # 01-10-2020-Day-7-Summary
 
For this section, the goal is to have a profound understanding of styling react components and elements. Not only the styles themselves can be dynamic - the classes we assign could also be. I learned that inline styles have some limitations so a package named Radium is introduced. It is useful for providing a way to style :hover, :focus, and :active states and it is also useful for Media Queries. This section also goes over enabling and using CSS modules and using them for pseudo selectors and media queries. This tool might not be necessary when working with a simple web application. However, if you're working on a large app with tons of components this will help you clean up your CSS.
