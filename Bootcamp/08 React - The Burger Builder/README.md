 # 01-14-2020-Day-9-Summary
 
In this mini project, we build a burger that consists of states, components, basically the necessary ingredients you would need just like if you were building an actual burger. No one wants a sloppy burger, you would want one done right. So in this case, we start off by planning the state, setting up the project by creating the layout component, starting the implementation of the Burger Builder container, adding a dynamic ingredient component as well as adding prop type validation. There's also some calculations involved where we calculate the ingredient sum dynamically, adding the build control component since it aleady exists but now you need to be able to edit it. After we are able to include multiple "ingredients," the burger therefore has multiple controls. There are also buttons that display an order summary, which displays and updates the burger price.
