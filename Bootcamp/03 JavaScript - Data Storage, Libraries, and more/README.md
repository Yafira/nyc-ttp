# Data Storage, Libraries, Expanding our JavaScript knowledge 
 
Choosing the right storage mechanisms for local device storage is essential when designing your web app. A good storage engine makes sure your information is saved reliably, reduces bandwidth, and improves responsiveness. In this section, I learned how to save data in our local storage to store notes and to-dos for later. Basic operations were also introduced such as targeting by Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), which is used to target your note and to-dos by their id. This will allow you to read their data, update the data or remove the item altogether. A lot of time is also spent from refactoring the code to debugging. This improves the quality and organization of our code without changing the application's behavior. Time in JavaScript is also emphasized in order to set up real-time data syncing across pages by parsing, manipulating and displaying the dates and times referred to as moment.
