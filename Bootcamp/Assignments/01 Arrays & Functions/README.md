## Goal:

To strengthen your understanding of JavaScript syntax, functions, and Higher-Order functions, and to understand Array methods.

## Assignment:

The following are some of the most popular and used methods in functional languages:

●	forEach <br>
●	Map <br>
●	Filter <br>
●	Some (Any) <br>
●	Every <br>
●	Reduce <br>


For this assignment, you will recreate these methods using JavaScript functions. 
Make sure to carefully understand what each method is designed to do, and DO NOT 
use any of the respective native JS methods to implement your solutions. 
Also, keep in mind that these methods do not mutate the input array. 
We highly suggest utilizing Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs to understand 
how each method works and what arguments they take. Also look into Array.prototype.push(), 
Array.prototype.pop(), Array.prototype.shift(), Array.prototype.unshift(), Array.prototype.slice(), 
Array.prototype.splice() methods as well.

### forEach()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.forEach” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myEach” that will take in an array of elements and executes any callback function on each of those elements.

### map()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.map” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myMap” that will take in an array of elements and executes a callback function on each of those elements.

### filter()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.filter” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myFilter” that will take in an array of elements and executes a callback function on each of those elements.

### some() (also known as any())

Without using the native “Array.prototype.some” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “mySome” that will take in an array of elements and executes a callback function on each of those elements.

### every()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.every” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myEvery” that will take in an array of elements and executes a callback function on each of those elements.

### reduce()

Without using the native “Array.prototype.reduce” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled “myReduce” that will take in an array of elements and executes a callback function on each of those elements.
