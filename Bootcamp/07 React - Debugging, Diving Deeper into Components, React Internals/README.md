In this section, we dive deeper into components and react internals. The lecture focuses on explaining the differences between Stateless and Stateful Components, Class-based vs Functional Components, Component Updating Lifecycle (for props Changes) as well as for state changes, and different fuctions that can be used for different situations. For example using useEffect() in Functional Components, controlling the useEffect() Behavior, cleaning up with Lifecycle Hooks & useEffect() and using shouldComponentUpdate which is an important lifecycle method - although there were other options mentioned that can have an easier time optimizing the component performance. High order components are also introduced - an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. A HOC is basically a function that takes a component and returns a new component. The name for that is an Auxiliary component.
