 # 01-09-2020-Day-6-Summary
 
This section focuses on app themes and applying Babel and Webpack to JavaScript. The goal for app themes is to integrate some styles into the three applications that were built in the prior lectures, including hangman, notes app, and todo app. At the same time, these videos give a deeper understanding on CSS at a high level by applying styles to various elements on the page. Babel and Webpack are two tools that will make it easier to create real-world JavaScript applications that work in a wide range of environments. Babel is a compiler for JavaScript that solves all of our cross-browser compatibility issues. Webpack allows us to take advantage of JavaScript modules to make it easy to share code between files, and allowing us to create more advanced applications without messy code. We continue to build on the hangman, notes and todo apps by converting it to use our boilerplate project with Babel and webpack. In this section, I also learned about object spread syntax and destructuring. Spread operator with objects gives you an easy way to create, clone, and merge objects. Destructuring lets you pull values out of an object or array and into their own variable.
