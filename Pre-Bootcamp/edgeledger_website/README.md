## Objective


There are many characteristics under HTML and CSS and two of them that can make a webpage stand out are Responsive Layouts and Flexbox. This project focuses on the basics, the different possible properties for the parent element (the flex container) and the child elements (the flex items). These elements create a better display for when viewing a webpage and makes it more appealing to the eyes for when you're searching for something in particular. Responsive layouts are designed to give you the ability to view a page on a desktop but also on a smartphone or tablet, however you prefer.
