# Scoped CSS and JavaScript

Exploring CSS variables will give the end user three inputs where they can edit the spacing, blur and color of elements in the web page. This can be improved by using JavaScript to update the values after its initial rendering. This is a simple assignment but gives you the ability to alter it and extend it for some real use cases.

# Objective

- Define the CSS variables

- Get data from inputs via JS using a forEach() loop and data attributes

- Select CSS variable to update style using proper suffix and dataset

- "et Voil√†!" you have a functional webpage with CSS variables updated.
