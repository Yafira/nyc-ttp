# Flex Panel Image Gallery

In this project we start with a HTML file that displays image panels horizontally. The goal is to change the image panels into a vertical display and add some animation in the image and text when each selection is clicked.


# Objective



- Use Flexbox on the panels styling to make it vertical.
  -- Flexbox is a layout method in CSS.

- Display the text horizontally centered and vertically spaced out to fill the height of the webpage.

- Use CSS selectors and transform to set the default position of the text

- Increase the width of the panel for the panel animation by creating the styling and use some JavaScript to activate the styles when the panel is clicked

- Lastly, animate the text so that it enters once the panel widening transition completes by adding an event listener for the end of the transition, and toggle the class with the transition
