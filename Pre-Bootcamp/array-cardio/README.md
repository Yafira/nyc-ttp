# Array Cardio

Array cardio, cardio arrobics (array + aerobotics, get it?) You name it. But this is indeed an array workout in JavaScript. This assignment doesn't mess with CSS or the extra stuff, it focuses on Array methods and how to work them out using filter, map, sort and reduce.

“Filter, map, sort, reduce. These are kind of like the gateway drug to functional programming.” - Wes Bos

# Objective

The goal is to get comfortable with reading and sorting data particularly in an array of inventors.



- Filter by Century of birth - list of inventors for those who were born in the 1500's.

- Create an array of full names, inventors' first and last fullNames using the map method.

- Sort the inventors by birthdate, oldest to youngest using the sort methods.

- Sort the inventors by years lived using the sort method.

- Create a list of Boulevards in Paris that contain 'de' anywhere in the name.

- Alphabetically sort the people by last name using the sort function and the split function to identify the last name.

- Count the instances of each of the data given using the reduce function.
