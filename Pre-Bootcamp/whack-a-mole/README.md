# Whack-a-mole

Hopefully no one really whacks a mole in real life but for the sake of this game, we can have a little fun capturing the little moles from the holes bunking them with a mouse click. This project is supposed to be a recreation of the classic Whac-A-Mole which is a popular arcade redemption game invented in the 70's. The goal is to click on a mole when it randomly pops up from a hole for a set amount of time.


# Objective

- Create a startGame function which is called once the start button is clicked, and resets the current score

- Keep track of score board, the holes, moles and clock among other variables defined globally

- Make sure moles aren't peeping out from the same hole as the last time

- Create a function that makes moles disappear once the game is over
