## Objective

<center>When we think of building a house what are the details we can think of to construct it? Well, a house needs a structure that consists of an interior and exterior and actual functions that should be performed for completion and usability. Three important attributes are structure, styling and functionality. This is how HTML and CSS works.</center>
<br><br>
<b>HTML</b> is the structure of a webpage, like the structure of a house or building. <b>CSS</b> focuses on the styling of the webpage which allows you to change colors, position and beyond. Basically, the design of the building or house, focusing on the details in the interior and exterior. JavaScript determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the webpage and determines what happens when users click, hover or type within certain elements. However, in this assignment we only focus on HTML, CSS and Sass. <b>Sass</b> is like CSS but with superpowers, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules, inline imports etc. It helps keep things organized and allows you to create style sheets faster.
